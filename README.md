# GoPhish Templates

This repository includes several GoPhish templates that I have used throughout various engagements and retired. When setting uo and configuring my first GoPhish installation I found that there was a lack of publicly available phishing templates. This repository is my attempt at giving back to the InfoSec community and providing examples of templates that had a high success rate. 

The most important part of a successful phish is time and effort!
